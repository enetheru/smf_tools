The purpose of smt_convert is:
* Take an image file and convert it into an tilefile.smt file and a tilemap.csv
* Create an image using tile sources, and an optional tilemap

Creation of a tile_file.smt from an image file, or set of image files.

I can see myself getting confused with how things are structured, can i mix tiles from images? can I use an image file as if it was multiple tiles? I am unsure as I cant remember how I implemented the code.
