Trying to work on how to get benchmarks happening for the map compiler so that I can appropriately direct my efforts.

the pymapconv program is weird and in a little subfolder of the main project, and doesnt appear nice to work with. I'm thinking that perhaps having it as a sumbodule that is checked out and built on demand might be useful.

or I can just skip that and perform my benchmarks in a separate repository.

I think the separate repository might be better, keep things clean and allows others to more accurately replicate my work.

Google bench appears to be aimed at code snippets, which can be useful if I was comparing like for like, I guess I could fork processes and start the things apart from the c++, but it seems that its not what I want.

Hmm interesting, I can use ctest which will give me timing numbers, I wonder if I can use ctest over multiple iterations.

A new challenger appears, there is a tool called hyperfine which appears to perform benchmarking analysis on command lines, which is kinda what I wanted to deal with.

Figuring out how to compile a map with pymapconv will be the first sort of hurdle.
And it's proving to be some of the most annoying software I have ever used.

Given what it's actually doing, I cant imagine that its fast, there are so many calls out to the system.
I think I can continue with making my tools work without much issue.
