I have a fundamental issue with the TiledImage class.
On the one hand I could set the properties manually, image size, image width etc.
On the other hand I can derive the image properties from the contents like tilesize, and array dimensions.
I also could make it so I can extract pixel regions, or tiles from the tiledImage.
