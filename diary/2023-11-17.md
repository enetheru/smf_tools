Blah, arrgh..

I've been refactoring tclap, and i hav run into a problem, dependencies between arguments which initially is completely normal, but now I am having trouble.

if I specify the mapx and mapy, then I can use those values to check input images
But I don't know ahead of time what those values are, so cant construct the constraint.

I need a constraint that relies on external values, which means a pointer of some desciption to the outside of the constraint such that it can check.

Perhaps if there were a data structure that got altered, and I can reference that one.
