------------------------------
After picking up this project again ten years later, I have some additional things I wish to do, like:
* make OpenImageIO file readers and writers for the SMT and SMF format's
* modernise the code
* re-work the logic

More thoughts on what to change:
* implement formatters for the objects that are missing
  * std::filesystem::path
  * smt
  * smf
  * etc

this almost requires a change to libfmt, which might not be a bad idea anyway.

I originally had ideas to enable different texture compression formats for the contents of the SMF file.
Also being able to specify the height map in terms of tiles.
These will have to wait until after I get things moving in the right direction.

I need to make a TODO file which I can use to direct attention.
