After picking up this project again ten years later, I have some additional things I wish to do, like:
* make OpenImageIO file readers and writers for the SMT and SMF format's
* modernise the code
* re-work the logic

More thoughts on what to change:
* implement formatters for the objects that are missing
  * std::filesystem::path
  * smt
  * smf
  * etc

this almost rquires a change to libfmt, which might not be a bad idea anyway.
