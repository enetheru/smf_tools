I just thought of a new idea for constraints, and that is to compose them.

So a new constraint that can be joined by two other constraints using AND, OR, NOT
I would have to think whether I can make it a list of constraints, which can be combined with operations, or whether it is simply a binary system.

Either way its outside the scope of what I am attempting right now.
