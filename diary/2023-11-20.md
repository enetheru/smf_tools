I need to figure out the workflow for how the map is written, and read.

I can split the writing into sections and use the io based writer to make that happen.

We don't need to update the pointers till the last minute.
I also need null writers for all the bits so that the calculations can happen. Otherwise the data pointed to will be bogus.

I can use the header dependencies diagram to figure out which items are logically the components.

each separated section becomes a component.

I can list them here
* height
* type
* mini
* metal
* grass
* features
* tilemap

There is a tension between keeping functions inside the smf class, and putting them in the readers. since the readers have to get the data from the file anyway, it seems logical that I use that liberally.

Perhaps I can make simple readers that provide only data, and then extend them with more complex readers that turn that data into what I want.
