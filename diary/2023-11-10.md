Re-Thinking things as I am struggling to continue refactoring from the existing state, the cmd line tools I have built already seem to make no sense.

Image Reconstruction
* Extracting all tiles from an smt
* Extracting all images from an smf
* Reconstructing an image from smt's and a map
* Reconstructing an image from smf, which references smt's

I want to think about it like I am making a new tool, eMapConv, or Enetheru's MapConv.
if I were to run this program then I would specify it like
mapconv command files

So extract would be a tool, or tool mode, and then I would specify what I want to extract, or I would just get everything.
reconstruct might be another tool.

What about construction?
* Create an SMT file with map from an image, with hash or perceptual duplicate skipping.
	* Bake in decals for metal, etc.
* Compile an SMF file from inputs
	* re-size images as needed
