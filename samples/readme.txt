These aren't necessarily *good* examples of how to use MapConv, or how to
make a good Spring map.

The .SMDs are modified from Small Divide, to boot.

I haven't learned how to properly package a map for Spring; I just symlink
the .smd, .smf and .smt into the maps directory.

1: The sample map that seems to have come with mapconv, historically.
   Old file names:

     257f.bmp -> feature.png
     257h.bmp -> height.png
     257m.bmp -> metal.png
     2kt.bmp  -> texture.png

2: A tiny map with one feature on it named myFeature, made for testing
   converting models to s3o.

   The metal patch under the feature is probably pointless. :)
